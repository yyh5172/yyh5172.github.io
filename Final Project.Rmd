# Research Question

### Are Trap Laws associated with lower reported legal abortion number?

* Trap Law: Targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP) laws are costly, severe, and medically unnecessary requirements imposed on abortion providers and woman's health centers. Often pushed by anti-abortion politicians under the guise of "woman's health," the real aim of TRAP laws is to shut down abortion providers and make it more difficult for people to access abortion.
